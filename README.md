# Agentic AI Research Agent

## Overview

This project implements an AI-powered research agent designed to retrieve, analyze, and summarize information while optimizing multi-step reasoning, memory retention, and efficient orchestration of large language models (LLMs). It leverages advanced prompting styles and integrates with Groq Cloud for multi-LLM orchestration. An optional vector database integration allows for memory retention across sessions.
